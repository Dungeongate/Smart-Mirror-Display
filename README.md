# This software is intended to work with the operating system Rasbian on the Raspberry Pi Computer 2|3
# The primary function of this software is to generate a universal customizable user interface involved with the DIY project 
# commonly known as the "Raspberry Pi Smart Mirror Display
# Our software is intended to be modular to allow for maximum amount of flexibility by the user
# Later versions of our software will require a wifi/bluetooth connection so a Raspberry Pi 3 is recommended
#
#
# Parts needed to assemble full project: Raspberry Pi, Mirror with two way capability, 
# Monitor that is the same size as 2-way mirror or vice versa, 
# wooden frame capable of housing Raspberry Pi with adequate ventilation and also holding the mirror and monitor in their appropriate spot.
#
#
# This software is free to the public
# PLEASE NOTE **We are currently still developing the software, so not all functionality has been implemented yet**
